Howdy!&nbsp;
I'm a retired professor of computer science.&nbsp;
I enjoy
- doing research in computational social choice and other areas of artificial intelligence,
- programming games, simulations and visualizations,
- solving programming-contest-style problems and
- experimenting with various programming languages, especially those with a functional design.

Currently I'm putting some older projects on GitHub to motivate myself to keep improving them.&nbsp;
Some of the old JavaScript code in particular is embarrassing&mdash;please don't judge!&nbsp;
See the `pairwise-ordering` project for an example of my modern JavaScript style.
