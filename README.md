Howdy!&nbsp;
I'm a retired professor of computer science.&nbsp;
I enjoy
- doing research in computational social choice and other areas of artificial intelligence,
- programming simulations and visualizations,
- solving programming-contest-style problems and
- experimenting with various programming languages, especially those with a functional design.
